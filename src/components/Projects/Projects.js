It models cities and routes as a directed, weighted graph and employs algorithms like Dijkstra's, Floyd-Warshall, Kruskal's, Prim's, Bellman-Ford, BFS, and DFS to enhance route planning, capacity optimization, and cost efficiency. The project provides insights for logistics, infrastructure planning, and improved connectivity."
